**4. Use of JustCopyTrade Platform and Services by Strategy Followers**

Regulatory Compliance. You represent that only your own proprietary capital is being used to fund your account. If this is not the case, you represent that you are properly registered or licensed in the jurisdiction where you are located, or exempt from such registration or licensure. You agree to immediately inform us in the event that the foregoing representation is no longer accurate.

Demo Version. We may provide you with evaluation version of the JustCopyTrade Platform for 30 days period.

Disclaimer Regarding Investment Decisions and Trading. Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in foreign currencies and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in investments involves a risk of substantial losses. YOU AGREE THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND IN INVESTMENTS IN GENERAL.

The use of any trading system, strategy or signals, including any system, strategy or signals included as a sample in, or that is or was developed using, the JustCopyTrade Platform and the Services or any data, information, products or services provided by or through the JustCopyTrade Platform and the Services, including trade signals from Strategy Providers, does not and cannot guarantee that you will make profits, increase profits or minimize losses.

You understand that there can be no guarantee that your use of the Services or the information disseminated through the JustCopyTrade Platform will result in profits. Further, you understand that such your use may result in substantial losses.

Additionally, trading results based upon hypothetical or historically-tested trading strategies or systems do not necessarily compare to results of actual trading. No hypothetical or historical trading record can account for the level of risk present in actual trading. Numerous factors relating to market conditions, the existence or nonexistence of specific events or circumstances, human error, human/emotional reaction to losses during actual trading, inherent limitations of certain hypothetical or historically tested models, particularly ones that do not operate at the “tick” (as opposed to open, high, low, close) level, volume of trade and liquidity differences between hypothetical models and actual trades, and other supply/demand differences that may not be addressed by hypothetical models, and other conditions and circumstances, can account for these differences. There is no guarantee that your hypothetical trading results, even if tested against historical data, will produce comparable actual trading results. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical or historically tested performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading system or strategy. The possible reasons for this include the likelihood that no trading strategy or system can, even with automated trading, be precisely executed as designed. YOU AGREE THAT FUTURE RESULTS MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE OR EQUAL TO REPRESENTATIONS OF PAST PERFORMANCE; REAL, INDICATED OR IMPLIED.

The practice of “Day Trading” involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, strategy or starting following a certain Strategy Provider, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks.

YOU ALONE ASSUME SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENTS OR DECISIONS YOU MAKE BASED ON THE JUSTCOPYTRADE PLATFORM OR ANY DATA, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE JUSTCOPYTRADE PLATFORM, INCLUDING TRADE SIGNALS FROM SIGNAL PROVIDERS.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE YOU OR ANYONE ELSE INCURS AS A RESULT OF ANY TRADING OR INVESTMENT ACTIVITY THAT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE ENGAGES IN BASED ON ANY INFORMATION, DATA OR MATERIAL YOU RECEIVE THROUGH THE JUSTCOPYTRADE PLATFORM, INCLUDING TRADE SIGNALS FROM SIGNAL PROVIDERS, OR AS A RESULT OF USE OF THE JUSTCOPYTRADE PLATFORM.

You also agree to bear complete responsibility for your choice of Strategy Provider(s) and acknowledge that we have not and will not make any specific recommendations to you upon which you are entitled to rely.

No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those achieved by Strategy Providers or any other traders. Your attempt to follow any trades provided by Strategy Providers may be hindered by the inherent delay in receiving and executing that trade; market liquidity, and your own trading issues, including, but not limited to slippage, commissions, trading software, and internet outages.

The returns for Strategy Providers listed throughout the JustCopyTrade Platform are hypothetical in that they represent returns in a model account. The model account may rise or fall by the exact single contract profit and loss achieved by clients trading actual money pursuant to the listed system’s trading signals on the appropriate dates, or if no actual client profit or loss is available, by the hypothetical single contract profit and loss of trades generated by the system’s trading signals over the test period.

The actual percentage gains/losses experienced by you will vary depending on many factors, including, but not limited to: the settings you have selected for trades mirroring, starting account balances, market behavior, your account settings, and the performance of Strategy Providers. Because of this, actual percentage gains/losses experienced by you may be materially different than the percentage gains/losses as presented through the JustCopyTrade Platform.

No Advice or Solicitation. The JustCopyTrade Platform is for informational purposes only. You acknowledge and agree that the JustCopyTrade Platform is not intended to supply investment or financial advice or a recommendation to trade using any specific Strategy Provider. We or Strategy Providers offer no advice regarding the nature, potential value, or suitability or any particular currency, transaction, investment or investment strategy. You should not construe any data or information provided by Strategy Providers as legal, tax, investment, financial or other advice.

Nothing in the JustCopyTrade Platform is a solicitation to buy, sell or hold foreign currencies or other investments or financial instruments.

Refund Policy. We will issue a refund to Strategy Follower for losses caused by Platform Errors, if the Strategy Follower provides timely notice of the error to us as described below.

A “Platform Error” occurs if a trading signal that should have been rejected according to the Strategy Follower’s Account settings is validated and accepted by us and submitted to the Strategy Follower’s Broker, or if a trading signal that should have been accepted according to the Strategy Follower’s Account settings is rejected by us and not submitted to the Strategy Follower’s Broker.

We shall not be responsible for refunding lost profits resulting from Platform Errors under any circumstances.

Errors of Strategy Providers shall not be considered Platform Errors, and we shall not be responsible for refunding losses or lost profits resulting from such errors under any circumstances.

Due to system architecture Strategy Followers may incur delays in trade copying. We do not compensate for delays up to 7 minutes.

In order to receive a refund of losses caused by Platform Errors, you must notify us in writing of your potential claim. You must deliver the written notice to us as soon as you knew, or should have known, of the Platform Error, but in any event, **no later than twenty-four hours after the Platform Error occurred**. If we do not receive such notice from you within twenty-four hours after the Platform Error occurred, we will not be liable for any losses resulting from the Platform Error.

If we confirm that the Platform Error occurred with respect to your Account, and you provided the required notice to us within twenty-four hours, you will receive a refund of your losses caused by the Platform Error (not including lost profits).

You are required to review your account statements and monitor your account status at least daily to ensure that the trades you ordered were placed, and that all trades that were made on your account were authorized by you.

**5. Strategy Provider’s Services and Obligations**

Strategy Provider’s Exempt Status. Strategy Provider represents and warrants that it does not direct or guide any customer accounts or provide trading advice based on, or tailored to the forex interests or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics of any customer.

The Strategy Provider further represents that it has obtained all required domestic and foreign governmental and regulatory licenses or registrations as may be necessary to provide Service Provider’s Services and carry out its obligations and duties under these Terms, or is exempt from such registration or licensure.

The Strategy Provider agrees and acknowledges that we are entitled at our sole discretion to grant a license to our partners who may use our platform under their brand and trade dress. The Strategy Provider hereby consents to provide Strategy Provider’s Services through our licensees’ websites and under their brands.

Verification of Strategy Providers. The name on your Account with us must match your true and legal name and identity, and must match the name on the payment accounts used to withdraw monies.

To verify your identity, we may request at any time:

- satisfactory proof of identity (including but not limited to copies of a valid passport/identity card and/or any payment cards used), and
- satisfactory proof of address (including but not limited to a recent utility bill or bank statement).

In the event Strategy Provider is a corporate entity, Strategy Provider shall provide its formation documents and information sufficient for us to determine the corporate or business entity’s identity, and the authority of its business representative to act on its behalf, as well as the business representative’s identity.

If you do not supply such documentation to us we may suspend or terminate your Account and we may withhold the account balance until you supply such documentation and our verification process is completed satisfactorily.

Ranking. As you trades as a Strategy Provider, your performance and position in the JustCopyTrade Platform ranking will evolve; moving up and down. You agree that we, at our sole discretion, decide what data and information are taken into consideration in order to calculate your place in the ranking.

Non-Solicitation. Strategy Provider agrees not to solicit to offer the services the same as or similar to Strategy Provider’s Services to any Strategy Follower while engaged in providing of Strategy Provider’s Services or for 6 month thereafter. Strategy Providers agree that it is impossible to fix with certainty the damage to us for breach of this non-solicitation provision, and Strategy Providers therefore agree that they will pay, for each breach of this provision, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the involved Strategy Follower commission accrued from this Strategy Follower over the most recent 6 full months. Such amount will be due and payable by the Strategy Provider within 10 days of receipt of a notice from us.

Independent Contractor. Strategy Provider is an independent contractor, and not our employee or agent, nor shall anything herein be construed as making Strategy Provider a partner or co-venturer with us or any of our affiliate. Strategy Provider shall have no authority to bind, obligate or represent us.

Compensation. Strategy Provider receives compensation for providing Strategy Provider’s Services to Strategy Followers calculated and paid by us according to the payment terms published on our website. The payment terms are the integral part of these Terms. Payment terms depend on the type of your Account with us (Pro, Live, High Risk, Demo, etc.), amount of commissions received from Brokers, your performance and other criteria set out by us at our discretion. We assign the Strategy Provider’s Account types to each Strategy Provider at our sole discretion.

Such compensation paid to the Strategy Provider will constitute full payment for Strategy Provider’s Services. The Strategy Provider will not receive any additional benefits or compensation under these Terms.

Strategy Provider’s compensation is calculated on a monthly calendar basis within 15 business days of the next calendar month.

For each specific calendar month that a Strategy Provider presents a negative balance (the end of month valuation of the Strategy Provider’s equity is lower than its valuation at the beginning of the month), the Strategy Provider will not be compensated, unless he has a Pro Account.

The Strategy Providers, who apply abusive trading behavior, introducing high risks to their Strategy Followers, will be examined carefully and if deemed malicious, they will be refused compensation and their Account may be terminated.

Withdrawals. Strategy Provider may request withdrawals of earned compensation at any time and in case all of the following conditions have been met:

- you have over US$100.00 at your balance,
- there are no withdrawal method restrictions,
- your identity has been sufficiently verified, and
- you are in compliance with these Terms.

We will pay you in the US dollars via bank wire transfer or other payment methods (if applicable and at our sole discretion).

You are responsible for any applicable taxes, duties, bank or payment provider fees or surcharges that may occur regarding the transaction. We may report and withhold any amount from your balance (for example, taxes) in order to comply with any applicable law.

After we accept your withdrawal request we will pay you in 15 business days.

In case these Terms are terminated by us or by Strategy Provider without a cause payment must be requested within 30 days of receipt of the termination notification. Payment requests received after this period will be rejected.
